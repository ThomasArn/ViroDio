# ViroDio

By Thomas Arn Hansen 2016/2017. 

A tool for explorative analysis of metagenomics sequence data, mainly for virus discovery. 

Virus discovery using Illumina sequencing can be dependent on few reads or small contigs with low homology to known references. This is a wrapper that uses different availble search tools (Kaiju, kraken, blastn and diamond) for explorative virus discovery. The translated searches are usually used in virus discovery to give higher sensitivity.
